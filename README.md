# Compare quantified neural networks for MNIST (images) and N-MNIST (events) data
1. Evaluation of lightweight neural networks' performance with event and frame-based data.
2. Examination of how quantization affects lightweight neural networks processing event and frame-based data.
3. Investigate the impact of parameter reduction and increased network depth on the performance of quantified neural networks

The results achieved can be found within the following folders:
* MNIST
* N-MNIST
